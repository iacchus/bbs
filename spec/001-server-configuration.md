* server config is made using `.toml` files
* server configfi can be made by using the `bbs-cli` command; we need to write `toml` programmatically
* we need to check the config using `bbs-cli`
* we can save backup previous configs using `git` or `tar.gz` files; also `.sqlite3` db files can be saved
