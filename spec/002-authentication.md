# authentication

* we can use authentication via pub/sec keys (gpg, rsa, bech32 etc)
* posts can be signed with keys
* registration can be done via "single click"
* clients can autosave authentication data/registration data
* users can provide other auth methods (*eg.*, an e-mail address) so they can futurely change the keys
